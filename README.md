# KNN-emission-reduction-
This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict emission reduction levels based on environmental, industrial, and demographic indicators. By learning patterns from similar regions, KNN estimates whether reduction targets are realistic and guides sustainability planning and policy decisions.
